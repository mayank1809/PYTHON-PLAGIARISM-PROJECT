# PYTHON-PLAGIARISM-PROJECT
This project has really been faithful and informative. It has made us learn and understand the many trivial concepts of Python Language. As we have used python Tkinter as a GUI it provides various controls, such as buttons, labels and text boxes to build a user friendly application.
The Plagiarism detector is created by using python language python is widely used general purpose, high level programming language. Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. And also Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
                                 
                                      It is designed by using GUI application. That can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
