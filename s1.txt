India is an excellent example of ‘unity in diversity’. In India, you will find culturally, regionally, and intellectually varied people. Indians hold their cultures and traditions very close to their heart. It is reflected in everything, from the language, art, fashion, scriptures, and rituals to customs, ethics, behaviours, values, etc. One of the most famous attributes of Indian culture is that Indians treat their guests as Gods (atithi devo bhava). It is the main reason why the country has a flourishing hospitality and tourism sector. For Indians, their cultures and traditions are not mere processes but a way of living. One of the most significant differences can be spotted in Indian weddings, where in some parts, the bride needs to wear a red-coloured attire on D-day, and in some, wearing white is considered auspicious. Cultures and traditions have many dimensions in India and can be seen in the variety of food, clothing, and art forms found in the country. No matter how modern the young generation is, their roots lie in the cultures and traditions followed in the country.
